# CerealCalorieAnalysis-Numpy

In this small python program, I used Numpy to analyze a set of data about calories of different cereal brands. I found the mean, median, and standard deviation of the dataset.

A reference point of 60 calories was used to find out whether of not it was within one standard deviation of the average.
